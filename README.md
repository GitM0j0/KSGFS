# SGFS
Stochastic Gradient Fisher Scoring for Neural Networks

The goal of this project is to combine the SGFS algorithm by Ahn et al. (2012) and the K-FAC algorithm by Martens/Grosse (2016) to build a large-scale MCMC sampler for Bayesian Neural Networks to sample from the posterior distribution of the weights.
